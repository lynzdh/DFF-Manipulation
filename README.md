# DFF-Manipulation
Dynamic Flex-and-Flip Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects

## Summary

This repository presents the implementation of flex-and-flip
manipulation tehcnique, suitable for grasping thin, flexible linear
objects lying on a flat surface. 

A paper strip is printed with April tag so that the robot knows position of the strip edge. Of course this position can be hardcoded.

Use two point contacts. Show the figure in the paper.

The repo should contain:
- Code to model deformable linear objects with minimum bending energy curves by specifying boundary conditions.
- How deformation energy varies with end-point constraints
- Friction and contact 2.
- 3D printable STL format gripper 
- Position control code with UR10
